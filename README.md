# suunto2python
Import exercise data recorded with Suunto Ambit 3 Peak from Suunto App json files. 

The current version is in an early development stage, but was tested successfully with data obtained with a Suunto Ambit 3 Peak that were synchronized with Suunto via the Android Suunto App. It might work as well with other Suunto watches, but could not be tested, yet. 

Json files that can be used for data import were found in the Android data folder of the Suunto App.
